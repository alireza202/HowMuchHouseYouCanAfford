# HowMuchHouseYouCanAfford

When buying a house, some people go for the most expensive house they can buy, but that may not be the right decision. In this simulation, we show that the house you buy plays a key role on how many years you have to work until retirement. For that, we simulate how your liquid assets grow year over year after buying a house, and how long it takes to reach "enough number".

Assumptions:

1. Your assets are invested.
2. You want to retire only based on your investments. Social security, for example, is not included in the calculations.
3. You don't want to sell the house at any point, and you plan to retire in that house, hence the house is not counted towards assets. The scenario of down-sizing at some point and retiring earlier is not supported.
4. Inflation is not taken into account when calculating the enough number, but that is ok, as long as investmentReturn is adjusted accordingly.
5. Wage growth or life-style inflation are not included in the calculation either. Obviously, if there is a chance to increase wage significantly in future, this estimate would be inaccurate. Same for a significant change in yearly expenses.
